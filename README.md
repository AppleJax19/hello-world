Learning to create repositories and use GitHub
Hello, My name is Jaxon Moffett.
I am currently an aspiring code monkey, though the road is a tough on to ride.
I hope to be able to use GitHub in an orderly manner and to be able to present
  my projects in one location.
I hope I can become a part of this community and continue to learn and grow through it.
